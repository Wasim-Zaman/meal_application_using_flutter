This will be triggered essentially whenever the references of the state change,
which also means it will be called when the widget that belongs to the 
state has been fully initialized and we can tap into context,
this will still run before build runs.

So in here, I can now put my code which I had in initState, 
initState would have been great if we wouldn't have required
 to use modal route of context in here,

so any of context stuff which you need to do in here will 
unfortunately not work but in didChangeDependencies, it should work.
